            <p>Welcome to my Odin Recipes webpage. A place to share some of my favourite Gluten Free recipes. Feel free to try them out and why not submit some of your own favourite recipes.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I was diagnosed with Coeliac's disorder in February 2020 right before the first Covid-19 lockdown. It has been a long journey learning to get to grips with this unfortunate disease. For me it was hereditary as my grandmother also has Coeliac's. She was diagnosed a number of years ago and has told me how awful it was back then when she was in her 40s. There was very little known and very little available. Tinned bread! Yuck! 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>While it has improved greatly now there are still many things you wouldn't even think of that unfortunately contain the dreaded gluten. Many places may advertise they are gluten free but not all of them are as strict as they need to be to avoid cross contamination. This can make for awkward times when going out to eat. </p>
            <br>
            <p>I wanted to make a personal site to share recipes. There are many great online resources already out there so I wanted to add to this. I have a great love of food so am always looking for ways to improve recipes where with gluten free alternatives they can sometimes be a bit lacking. </p>
            <br>
            <p>See below some of the amazing recipes you can find only a few clicks away.</p>
